Hi, My name is Hoon. I'm a computer programmer and working as a full-stack software engineer at an e-commerce company in Singapore. I'm using React for front-end and Java for back-end, and thinking about starting new  areas in a near future.

Since I took a journey to South East Asia in 2016, I've found that Singapore is a great country for people who want to work in international environment and decided to move from South Korea. This blog is to post stories about life and tech journey.
