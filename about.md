Hi, My name is Hoon. I'm a computer programmer and working for an e-commerce company as a full-stack software engineer in Singapore. I'm currently using React for front-end and Java for back-end, and thinking about starting other tech areas in a near future.

Since I travelled South East Asia in 2016, I've found that Singapore is a great country for people who want to work in international environment and decided to live here. I'll post stories about living and tech.
