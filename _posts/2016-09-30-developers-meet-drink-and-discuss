The biggest change since I came to Singapore is I've started attending developer meetups. I thought this kind of meetup culture was too unfamiliar to me and felt like a different world story when I read BaekJun Lim's column "Developers, meet, drink and discuss".

Recently there is a movement to start this kind of developers culture also in Korea. But I wouldn't be interested in and attend because of my laziness if I was in Korea, but here, I search meetup schedule and try to attend as much as I can in order to overcome the loneliness as a stranger. I even surprised to myself that I discover my active personality.

First meetup that I attended was "Data Visualisation" of Hacker in Singapore, which is introducing how to visualise data using Javascript. Normally this kind of meetup is sponsored by IT giants, Microsoft provides the venues as sponsor, so it was a great opportunity to have a look around their office. And even free pizzas!

Next day, I went to Spring meetup, which is held Paypal office this time. Free pizzas as well, and even got free drinks from the vending machine!

There were 3 sessions at the same time in a big meeting room about Scala, Angular and OAuth. I went to Scala session to glance the hottest language, but our speakers voice is to low in compare to others' voices, so it's hard to concentrate on and went out in the middle of session. So sorry about that but I wanted to go another one, which is held at the same time :-)

The place that I was heading after getting out the Paypal office was Clark quay, which is famously knows as nightlife in Singapore. There was a Python developers' party called "beer.py". I was little worried how I could find them with only a few pictures of some members on Facebook but it was really easy to find because one of them wore a t-shirt prined "Hello World". It's not very comfortable to talk a lot each other in the previous to meetups because they was tech seminars, but this had great atmosphere to talk anything to each other.

"Hi, My name is Hoon from Korea. I'm travelling south east Asia at the moment and would like to work in Singapore if I have a chance"

There are various people doing different things; a real digital nomad from Chile, a data scientist,  a undefined person who looks like a hacker. I talked with people who is hiring backend developers, and also a Italian guy recommended me to join the programming community called "Recuse Center" in New York if I really want to elaborate programming ability. After the meeting, I was little lost in conception on Clark Quay where these so many people come from and go?

Next day, meet up again. Same Paypal office. Free pizzas and drinks! It was "Talk.js" meetup in Singapore JS community and several sessions about debugging, React Natvie, JS on JVM. I met one who attend the Spring meetup yesterday as well and she sealed hiring to an IT consulting firm and now studying on her own to catch up with recent technologies. I talked about making a study group together for mutual interests. After the official sessions, quick speeches to recruit React developers was followed for a while and it seems like there are hight demand for the technology. I was little overwhelmed that this developer was happening, that I just heard from the internet that it's a different world story, in front of my eyes.

It was little unfamiliar to me first time to start conversation with strangers and it's even in English. But since I spent really enjoyable time in beer.py, I feel like I'm becoming more confident to make new friends here. People in Singapore speak great English, but because it's also second language to many of them, they listen carefully,understand well and answer although I speak in poor english. MeetUp is a great blessing for travelers like me who wants to hang out with local people. Developers! meet, drink and hang out!
