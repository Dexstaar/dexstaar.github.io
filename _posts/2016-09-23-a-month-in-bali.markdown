It's been a month I've stayed in Bali. I was thinking about staying here more than one month but realized that I can not stay more that 30 days here unless I got an arrival visa. Now I'm at the airport and waiting for the flight to Singapore.

Things that I've been doing in Bali

- Things I learned
Surfing: A thing that I try at first in Bali. It was really enjoyable at first and I thought I found a new passion. But the more I went, I started hating paddling, which is bloody weary. And one accident, a board hit my chest while going into the water, made me completely stop the activity. I was worried whether I had a crack on my rib but fortunately it was fine when I got diagnosis at a hospital.
Yoga: In order to cure my exhausted muscle and mental, I started practicing Yoga. The Thing that I like the most for this excercies is, I've almost always got nervoused when I started other sports that I've been doing such as cycling, crossfit, surfing, but this really makes me comfortable. It's also more energetic than I expected, so I think this would be my regular excercise.
Scooter: Roads are not friendly for pedestrians but I was keep trying to walk becuase I couldn't get used to when I tried a couple of times. But when I was threatened a wild dog dark in the night while I was coming back to the hotel, the incident strongly motivates me to learn to ride it.

- Coding Asceticism
1 day 1 Codility: One of the plan is I would solve 1 question per day on Codility. I've solved 16 for 24 days, which I've solved 0.6 per day. It was almost archieved if I consider the days that I couldn't do anything except for surfing :-p
Mobile app: I started learning AngularJS first in order to utilize Ionic, which is a framework that wraps to look a mobile app-ish. But in Outpost lunch talk meeting, I've found that someone develops an app using React Native, since that I'm also thinking about using it. The difference is React Native converts the JS source code to make it as real mobile apps for both platforms.
Editor: It looks like editor wars in the world. Technology changes so fat liek new languages come up, new editors come up. I've only using Eclipse for Java coding, but I changed the editor to IntelliJ since I became to keen on Jetbrains products such as WebStorm.

- Living
I've moved my accommodation 3 times. a hotel and a homestay in Canggu, and two hotels in Ubud. The last place that I stayed is Budhi Ayu. It's very quite and located in a remote area, which means, little scary to go out after sunset. It even has horrific internet access so I've had pretty healthy life style, went to bed and woke up early.


I prefer the location that I stayed lastly than Ubud center. There is a small town to the opposite side of the monkey forest from the center, and I'd love the stay there if I come to Ubud again. I've explored this place since I moved the co-working space from Hubud to Outpost. I loved the new office because it is much more quiet and has wider desks, air-conditioned space, better condition to concentrate for individuals. It's my favorite among the co-working spaces that I've visited in Bali.

- Taman Hati Studio



After moving, I've explorered yoga studios around there because Yoga Barn is little far from there. Ubud Yoga Center is in a luxurious building and the harmony with nature is captivating. Unfortunately, it's only running hot yoga studio, and I couldn't breath with the temperature during the class. Another place is call Haman Kandi studio, which is run by local yogi master. The class didn't attract me very much. There's also a pilates studio called Movement Matters and I'd like to try someday if I visit Ubud again. There is a shortcut to Ubud center belong the monkey forest, which is not shown on Google map, so that people can go to opposite side quickly.

I've had a lot of flexibility of this Bali trip because I stayed here for such a long time. But huge flexibility is not always helpful. I've spent money much more than I planned and couldn't spent much time things that I was supposed to do. I should spend less time for exploring, and find a way to spend my time more productively. But there are so many places that I'd like to explorer. Next stop is Singapore.
