It's been two months that I've stayed in Singapore and now I'm in the Changi airport and waiting for the flight to back to Korea. What have I done for two months?

# Job Searching

Job searching is the biggest reason why I came to Singapore. During 2 months, I had a couple of opportunities to have interviews. But I still think that Singpore has generous culture and is very opened for foreigners so people who don't have overseas experience like me can even have interview opportunities. Unfortunately, I've failed to get a job offer this time but it's becoming more clear what I should prepare to have an overseas opportunity.

First of all, my tech stack is not very attractive. There are huge demand of developers here but thats for those who have skillful at modern technologies. For example, current modern web architecture is segregating front-end from back-end so that multiple client can use back-end resources through APIs. Also SPA (Single Page Application) using Javascript frameworks has spurred a wave of innovation worldwide, so I feel I'm behind of this modern web era when I was talking about my background like server-side rendering with MVC pattern.

In addition to this, practicing algorithm is never ending. Coding interview is inevitable if you are seeking for a computer programming job regardless of type of companies. This is the weakest part for me as a non computer science majored programmer, and started practicing it intensively since I left the previous company. But it's to keep it up within short period what others have been doing for years. Doing live coding in front of interviewer is like making a presentation in public. No matter how much I prepare, I could just show 50~70% that you prepared unless you are a natural born live coder. There are pros and cons that this kind of coding interview is effective to measure candidates' ability,  nevertherless, I feel the improvement of my ability to understand source code since I started studying and will keep practicing as long as I do coding.

# MeetUp

I really like this internationalized meetup culture in Singapore. I've been attended meetups as much as I could if it's related to my background or interest. Participants came from all over the world, professionalism of presenters. It's helpful to keep up with latest technology and directions of my development if I'm listening to coming and going in-depth discussions and also they made me sometimes lose confidence and stimulate my coding asceticism.



# Multinational Culture

I don't feel any barrier to melt into local people's life. The society is composed of people from all over the world especially the industry that I work is certainly has high proportion of foreigners thus having natural atmosphere to anyone who cam into the society. This is the country that I want to live among the one I have visited. Unfortunately, I couldn't find a proper opportunity while I've been staying here this time but will keep trying to find a way.
