In a plane to Bali
<br/>
<br/>



The most stressful moment during a trip is moving to the hotel with a heavy suit case when I arrive at a new place and everything is unfamiliar. I still remember the first time I visit Shanghai. It was cold, rainy evening in late autumn and I felt like I was in the movie Blade Runner when I saw the street with Chinese character neon signs and fog rise from the street (May be it's because I took the maglev train from the airport). And the fake cab overcharged me 10 times expensive than normal fare and dropped me in a wrong place.

To avoid struggling, I've booked airport pick-up to the hotel, but the driver didn't show up at the arrival gate. And the hotel front desk asked me to grab a taxi when I called there. I was just supposed to take an overpriced airport taxi. (I knew the normal fare but didn't want to spend much time there for price negotiation in the very late night).

Next day, I had a look around Canggu to buy some daily necessities. Easily got most, but unable to find a place that sell local SIM card here. Furthermore, it's also hard to call a cab using app either uber or bludbird. That's the reason why a lot of people ride motor bikes. I prefer walking for exercising, but should think about renting a bike to find SIM card seller.

I've registered in Dojo Bali, which is a co-working space here. It's peace and quiet place and has cute swimming pool(?!).

- Batu Bolong beach
<br/>
<br/>


After watching people are going surfing at Batu Bolong beach near the hotel, I have been trying to contact surfing classes but one is fully booked until 1 Sep and others don't answer. The first plan is enjoying surfing here before moving to Ubud in Sep, but I have bad feeling that I can go surfing while I'm staying in Canggu.
