Since I had arrived Singapore, surprisingly I was contacted by a Google recruiter a few days after I had changed my location to Singapore on Linkedin. He was looking for a person who could speak Korean and perform as a technical consultant.

These days, many companies have coding interview processes when they hire computer programmers, Google famous while board coding interview is one of the originators to make this widespread world-widely. When an interviewer asks several algorithm questions, a candidates choose a language to use and write down compilable source code on a whiteboard. A interviewer sometimes gives constraint conditions or hints when a candidate is stuck. It is quite effective method to figure out candidate's both programming knowledge and communication within a short time.

Cracking the coding interview
<br /><br />  



I have been practicing algorithm coding using online services since I stayed in Bali thus giving me little confidence to challenge. Since I was in the hiring process, I tried to practice programming with pan and paper or using a simple text editor and tried to avoid using IDE as much as I could. Also asked a programmer friend who i met in a meetup and practiced the white board coding interview in a  borrowed meeting room.

First step was phone screening, I was talking to the recruiter on the phone and he asked some questions about my career background. Then, he also asked some technical short answer questions such as web technology, time complexity, linux commands and sql. A few days later, I was invited to the next step. Second step was on-line tech interview using Hangouts and gDocs. A interviewer was the person who is doing the same role in another country and he firstly asked about experience of my tech stack, then provided some hypothetical questions and asked me how to solve the problem technically. Then some simple coding test using a shared gDoc was followed.

A few days later, I was invited to the onsite interview. I was really excited that I could experienced the famous white board coding interview.  I went to the Google office in Singapore and attended interview with the hiring manager. He asked typical non-tech interview questions for the first half, then for next half, asked me to design an architecture of a hypothetical system with giving some requirements. The first requirements was very unclear so that I kept asking to specify the requirements but hard to understand what he really wanted. Eventually I drew a typical SOA architecture that can provide some digital contents selling/publishing functions. I still don't understand what was the system feature he wanted and the recruiter contacted me a few days later that I would not be invited to the further assessment of the hiring.

Some people say Google's coding interview was a fascinating experience to beyond his/her ability while discussing how to improve the performance with interviewers, whereas some others say that they felt like they were ignored because of rigorous challenges. I really want that I would feel the prior one either I could pass or not. Unfortunately I couldn't even get to the white board coding interview stage and my real experience of it is still grey waves.

My overall impression of their hiring process is very well organized and smoothly going. They no longer ask brain teaser questions and focused on fundamentals. Interviewers and recruiters treated candidates in a very polite manner and provided necessary informations as much as possible. This is basic and what companies are supposed to do when they are recruiting but it's rarely meet this kind of manner in a real world.
