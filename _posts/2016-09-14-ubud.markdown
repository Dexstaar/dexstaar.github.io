Places those you stay takes a great possession of travel. Some might consider only price because it's only for sleep, but the person who spends most time in a room after sunset like me gets huge impression of the religion. Of course it can be better if I would spend money but long-term travellers should save money so I could just search for reasonable priced hotels on trip advisor.

During the last week while I'm in Ubud, The Grand Sunti hotel gave me a miserable experience, which is compared to others with similar price range. Dark, dirty, low water pressure and no hot water. I even wanted to quit this journey while I was suffering from enteritis and lying on the bed for two days.

Hubud, one of the most famous co-working space and a symbol of digital nomadism. I spent most of day time there but it was full of people and hard to find proper desk to concentrate during day time. It seems to be occupied some Australian start-up teams and not many independent computer programmers there.

Another hot spot that makes Ubud earn the reputation is Yoga barn. I've been reading many articles that people practice yoga and meditate to make their life fulfilling and dreaming about visiting the place. Mysterious and oriental atmosphere and huge size attracts many yogis and all classes are full with people. Personally I miss the less-crowdness where I practiced in Canggu.

Eventually I've moved to outside area of Ubud to avoid crowdedness. A new hotel, Budhi Ayu is near Outpost, which is a newly established co-working space . It's cheaper than almost IDR 100,000 per day but more clean and quite and also the Outpost gives much more space to each member. There is also new Yoga centre, so I feel this new location more fits to concentrate on eat, yoga and code than Ubud center . But need to hire a scooter because there's not many place I can go on foot.
