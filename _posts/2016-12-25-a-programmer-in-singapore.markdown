A few years ago, I read a travel log of a Korean architect who lives in Italy. I was overwhelmed by his knowledges and insights with life experience in different cultural areas and inspired me of thinking a life overseas. Since then, I made my mind that I would live in a foreign country someday in order to expand my range of vision to understand the world.

Another book that gave huge influence to my life is a novel written by a Korean computer programmer who lives in New York. It is based on his professional experience in finance industry in New York city and describes how people work there and what would be the attitude that programmers are supposed to have. At that time, I was wondering whether I would keep this career or change to a different area a lot and this book was a kind of lighthouse that motivated me to devote myself to computer programming.

Since then, I was dreaming like "I want to live overseas in order to experience different environment", "I want to work in an environment like discussing about modern technologies and how to write beautiful source codes with colleagues, not just considering schedule and cost". I was just wondering it on my own for years because I thought I was not ready. But last summer, I felt like I was possessed by something and left Korea with a one way ticket to let myself run into anything whatever the outcome to get closer to the dream.

During the 3 month travel under the name of "Coding Asceticism", honestly I don't feel much improvement of my coding skill. Nonetheless, I felt how the world is being changed rapidly while meeting with computer programmers in various sectors and countries and was aware how much narrow views I had. Also I realized coding skill is not the one I can improve shortly but the one that I should develop and sharpen with long term and sustainable plan.

Just after I returned from the journey, a surprising news came to me that I was invited job interview by a company that I attended their tech event in Singapore. Honestly, I disappointed to myself that I had no longer opportunities after a couple of time failures of job interviews in Singapore and also was not confident because I thought I was pretty behind of modern tech stack. I was worried that I would waste a few weeks to prepare for the interviews. Unlike my concerns, things were actually going pretty well although I was struggling a couple of time live coding sessions during the interviews. I have finally got a job offer.

The redivivus opportunity in Singapore. I'm obviously excited. On the other hand, I'm little nervoused about complete moving of my life base. But the attitude to get closer to be a cosmopolitan would be not falling into temptation of familiarity and not fear for novelty.

I am a programmer in Singapore.
