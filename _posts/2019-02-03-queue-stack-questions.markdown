## Queue




## Weave
#### Directions
1) Complete the task in weave/queue.js<br/>
2) Implement the 'weave' function.
Weave receives two queues as arguments and combines the contents of each into a new, third queue.
The third queue should contain the *alterating* content of the two queues.  
The function should handlequeues of different lengths without inserting 'undefined' into the new one. <br/>
 *Do not* access the array inside of any queue, only
 use the 'add', 'remove', and 'peek' functions.
#### Example


#### Solution




## Stack



## Queue From Stacks
#### Directions
 Implement a Queue datastructure using two stacks.
 *Do not* create an array inside of the 'Queue' class.
 Queue should implement the methods 'add', 'remove', and 'peek'.
 For a reminder on what each method does, look back
 at the Queue exercise.
