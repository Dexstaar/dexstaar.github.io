It's been 10 days since I arrived Bali. Frankly speaking, I've just too much enjoyed freedom and unfornately haven't done things that I've planned when I started this journey. The reason is.. surfing!

The first surfing was so enjoyable, but that was the straw that broke the camel's back. The more I do, the more I can not do any other things because I got drained every time I finished it. Having said that, I sometimes steal a glance surfers' party ;-p

Another passion that I've found here is Yoga. After going surfing in the morning, I go to a yoga centre called The Practice and roll & release muscle.

Canggu is a perfect place to have a vacation to chill out with surfing and Yoga. But I've just rounded off the life here and will move to Ubud in order to do what I have to do. My real digital nomadic life will be start there soon.
